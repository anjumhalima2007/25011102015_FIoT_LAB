## 2. Core Logic / Pseudocode / Code Base

**Working Principle:**

This experiment demonstrates bare-metal GPIO output control using the AT89S52 microcontroller. The `reg51.h` header file provides access to the 8051 registers, while the `sbit` keyword assigns the P1.0 pin to the variable `ledpin`.

The LED is switched ON and OFF continuously by assigning logic HIGH and LOW values to the pin. A custom delay function using nested loops introduces a time interval between the LED transitions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. Include the 8051 register header file.
2. Assign P1.0 to the LED using `sbit`.
3. Define a custom delay function using nested loops.
4. Enter an infinite loop.
5. Set the LED pin HIGH to turn the LED ON.
6. Call the delay function.
7. Set the LED pin LOW to turn the LED OFF.
8. Call the delay function again.
9. Repeat continuously.

**Code Base:**

- `#include <reg51.h>` provides access to 8051 special function registers.
- `sbit ledpin = P1^0;` assigns the P1.0 pin to the LED variable.
- `delay()` implements a software delay using nested loops.
- `ledpin = 1;` drives the LED output HIGH.
- `ledpin = 0;` drives the LED output LOW.
- `while(1)` continuously repeats the LED blinking operation.

The program uses direct register-level GPIO control without Arduino APIs, HAL libraries, or RTOS services.

## 3. INFERENCE

The experiment demonstrates successful bare-metal GPIO output control using the AT89S52 microcontroller. The LED connected to P1.0 blinks continuously due to alternating HIGH and LOW output states.

A custom software delay function is implemented using nested loops, demonstrating basic timing control without using external libraries. Thus, the experiment provides an understanding of 8051 register access, GPIO configuration, and simple embedded C programming.
