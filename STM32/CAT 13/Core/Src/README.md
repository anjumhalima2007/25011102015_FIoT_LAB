### 2. Core Logic / Pseudocode / Code Base

**Working Principle:**

The experiment demonstrates communication between the STM32 Nucleo development board and the BME280 environmental sensor using the I²C protocol.

The STM32 communicates with the BME280 through the I2C1 peripheral. The Bosch BME280 Sensor API is integrated into the STM32 firmware to simplify sensor initialization, configuration, and data acquisition.

Initially, the STM32 HAL library and system clock are initialized. The GPIO and I2C1 peripherals are configured using STM32CubeMX.

The BME280 device structure is initialized with the I²C interface, device address, read callback, write callback, and delay callback functions.

The `bme280_init()` function initializes the sensor and checks whether communication is successful.

The sensor settings are configured with 1X oversampling for temperature, pressure, and humidity. The filter coefficient is disabled, and the standby time is set to 1000 ms.

The sensor is then configured in normal operating mode using `bme280_set_sensor_mode()`.

Inside the infinite loop, the STM32 continuously acquires sensor data using `bme280_get_sensor_data()`. If the operation is successful, the temperature, pressure, and humidity values are extracted from the sensor data structure and stored in their respective variables.

Pressure is converted from Pa to hPa by dividing the measured value by 100.

A delay of 1000 ms is introduced between successive sensor readings.

**Pseudocode:**

1. Initialize the HAL library.
2. Configure the system clock.
3. Initialize GPIO and I2C1 peripherals.
4. Configure the BME280 I²C device address as 0x76.
5. Initialize the BME280 device structure.
6. Assign the following callback functions:
   - I²C read function.
   - I²C write function.
   - Delay function.
7. Initialize the BME280 sensor using `bme280_init()`.
8. Configure sensor settings:
   - Temperature oversampling = 1X.
   - Pressure oversampling = 1X.
   - Humidity oversampling = 1X.
   - Filter coefficient = OFF.
   - Standby time = 1000 ms.
9. Configure the sensor to normal operating mode.
10. Enter the infinite loop.
11. Acquire temperature, pressure, and humidity data using `bme280_get_sensor_data()`.
12. If the sensor data acquisition is successful:
    - Store temperature in the `temperature` variable.
    - Convert pressure from Pa to hPa and store it in the `pressure` variable.
    - Store humidity in the `humidity` variable.
13. Introduce a delay of 1000 ms.
14. Repeat the process continuously.

| Humidity    | `humidity`    | % RH |

**Expected Output:**

The STM32 should successfully communicate with the BME280 sensor through I²C and continuously acquire environmental measurements.

The acquired values are stored in the following variables:

```c
temperature = comp_data.temperature;
pressure = comp_data.pressure / 100.0f;
humidity = comp_data.humidity;
```

Expected sensor parameters:

- Temperature: Ambient temperature in °C.
- Pressure: Atmospheric pressure in hPa.
- Humidity: Relative humidity in percentage.

The readings are updated approximately every 1000 ms when sensor acquisition is successful.

### 3. Inference

The STM32 Nucleo development board successfully interfaces with the BME280 environmental sensor using the I²C communication protocol and Bosch Sensor API.

The sensor is initialized using its primary I²C address (0x76), and the required configuration parameters are programmed through the STM32 I2C1 peripheral.

The firmware continuously acquires temperature, pressure, and humidity measurements using `bme280_get_sensor_data()`. The acquired values are extracted and stored in their respective floating-point variables. Pressure is converted from Pa to hPa for convenient representation.

Thus, I²C-based BME280 sensor interfacing, sensor configuration, and environmental data acquisition using the Bosch Sensor API and STM32 HAL libraries are demonstrated successfully.
